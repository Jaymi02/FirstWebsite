              <p>Gaming communities can also stimulate your creativity and problem-solving skills by encouraging you to explore, experiment, and discover new knowledge and skills. They also
                 improve your memory, attention, spatial reasoning, and mental flexibility by requiring you to process and manipulate information in different ways.</p>

              <p>Video games have become a very social form of entertainment, with teams and players cooperating to reach a common goal. Over 70% of gamers play with a friend, by playing against each other or working cooperatively in a team. Games such as World of Warcraft open up virtual worlds and communities that extend far beyond the computer screen.</p>
